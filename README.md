# parameter-framework sample files

This repository contains Structure files for the
[parameter-framework](https://github.com/01org/parameter-framework). These are
either for documentation/example purposes or are real-life Structures that
support existing systems (e.g. audio codecs found on smartphones and tablets).

## Installing the examples

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=</your/installed/pfw/plugin/dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</example/destination> .
    make install
